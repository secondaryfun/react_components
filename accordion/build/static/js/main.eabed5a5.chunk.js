The Black Hand are criminals, and Padric hated that Grace was working to any capacity with them. He worried that Grace knew about Malik\u2019s treachery and was okay with it it so long as it furthered her own ends and helped Rhamsted prosper financially to make her look good to the other royalty. Padric probably could have looked the other way in either case, but when Aisling came to town, everything changed. Padric and Aisling wanted to stop Malik, and to uncover his criminal activities to Balthazar, to Kezia, to Grace, or to anyone who would listen. But as they searched for proof that would damn either Malik or Grace, Aisling got out of hand. She got the idea that Grace was as guilty as Malik. As Aisling\u2019s past came to light, Padric worried that their schemes had escalated from bringing justice to Malik, to getting revenge on him and anyone else turning a blind eye.

If they were wrong, it could mean trouble for both of them.</span></li>","<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\\">As Padric talked, Remi looked increasingly uncomfortable at the extent of her father\u2019s criminal activities being talked about in such a public setting.

He admitted that his actions weren\u2019t out of altruism, revenge, or any other need to see Grace and Malik imprisoned. He just loved Aisling and got fired up by her fervor. But when things got out of hand he failed to convince her to let it go. If it wasn\u2019t for what the group had just told Padric he wouldn\u2019t have even believe that Aisling was behind the murder that happened to the information broker. But if the information broker really died in such a spectacular fashion, it could only mean one thing.

The Hegemonix was a magical puzzle box from Arkalla, dangerous and capable of calling down exalted espers. They\u2019re plan was to steal an artifact as proof for the King. It was likely that Asiling went to steal the artifact and got caught, then used it to kill the information broker. </span></li>","<li><span style=\\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\\">Padric claims he has to end this, and he can\u2019t let Aisling hurt anyone else.

Elias Hyde was both the Duke of Hyde and an old friend of Balthazar. He was known as kind and caring.

And despite Remi\u2019s anger towards Aisling, seeing her father kill her in cold blood was still hurtful and unexpected. Regardless, Padric forgives her. He had feelings for Aisling, but he knew that what transpired wasn\u2019t Remi\u2019s fault.

At this point, the Harbingers are at a stand-still short of breaking into the house and kidnapping the girl. And as any \u201cPrincess of Elenia\u201d would know, this is avoided at all cost.

Suri explains that creatures from different dimensions can create a Soul Bond with each other, allowing them to travel freely between worlds. Faust was Isla\u2019s Soul Bond and this was highly illegal. Although this is usually safe, Suri\u2019s home world of Arkalla is one of the dimensions that is off limits from travel.

The red headed girl screams out as the Lion-Beast tears the human vessel into pieces, exposing the creature that was habitating the human body.
