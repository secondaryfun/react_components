For these reasons, we've decided to expand upon Gigas Grip in the same way we did Summoning. Future printings of Gigas Grip will say: \"Passive: You Gain Gigas Grip.\" Then, we will expand upon what the Gigas Grip Tag does for you. This will allow us to fit all the intricacies required by using the Rule Book instead of trying to jam it all onto a single mini card. We've added a new section to the Rule Book for Gigas Grip. Additionally, we've added an example in the Rule Book to make it clear how this functions in practice. The rule now says: \n\n\"The Gigas Grip Discipline in Martial allows an Adventurer to dual wield larger Melee Weapons. In addition to the normal rules for equipping gear, Adventurer's with the Gigas Grip ability may equip (2-handed)  (Melee) or  (Melee/Ranged) Weapons as if they were (1-handed) weapons. If they do, the following rules apply:\n\n• While equipped, 2-Handed Weapons still count as 2-Handed Weapons for the purpose of other abilities that might reference them.\n\n• These equipped 2-Handed Weapons must still adhere to the normal Range Icon restrictions when equipping Items. ***Example:*** Both weapons can be  Melee. One weapon can be  Melee and the other can be  Melee/Ranged. Or, both may be  Melee/Ranged. \n***Important:*** Even with Gigas Grip, Weapons with the  Melee Icon may not be paired with Weapons with only the  Ranged Icon.\n\n• You may still equip 1-Handed Weapons of any type following all the rules associated with equipping Weapons normally. ***Example:*** You could equip a 1-Handed  Ranged Weapon and a 2-Handed  Melee/Ranged Weapon. But it's important to remember that Gigas Grip doesn't allow you to equip a 2-Handed Ranged weapon as if it was 1-Handed.)\n\n• While these Weapons are equipped, you gain access to all Abilities printed on both equipped Weapons including any Abilities printed on Upgrades applied to either card.\n\n• When Attacking, you must choose which Combat Dice to use. This can be any combination of 2 (non-black) Combat dice printed across either of your equipped Weapons. If one or more of your equipped Weapons has the Black  printed in its Combat Dice pool, you must add a single Black  to your Combat roll. If an equipped Weapon has a different Range or an Ability that might augment the Range of an Attack, (Such as Reach 2 or Range 4), then you must use the lowest Range or Reach available to both weapons.\n***Example:*** If one  Melee Weapon has Reach 2 and the other  Melee does not, you may only Attack figures on Adjacent spaces. Alternatively, if one equipped Weapon has Range 4 and the other has Range 6, you may only make Attacks against figures at Range 4. Lastly, if you have an equipped  Melee Weapon with Reach 2 and an equipped  Melee/Ranged Weapon with Range 4 you could only make Attacks against adjacent figures.\n\n• If at any time you equip a Weapon that you would not be able to equip with Gigas Grip (or otherwise), you must immediately end your current Action and Abilities (if you are currently taking an Action or Ability). Then, Un-equip weapons so that your equipped weapons are legal. ***Example:*** This might happen if you used an ability that flipped a 2-handed  Melee Weapon into a 2-handed  Ranged Weapon.

We also removed the rule that prohibited Flanking from different Elevations. There was no reason to make this exception. Instead, we addressed how Reach interacts with Flanking. This rule also affected the quick reference in the back of the Book regarding Elevation. Basically, it got so big we had to simply reference the correct section instead. The rule now says:\n\n\"Elevation is a change in height on the game board. When there is an Elevation change, it is denoted with a dashed purple line and Elevation box. The following rules apply:\n\n• Figures cannot draw Line of Sight to a target on higher Elevation unless the target is on the edge of the higher Elevation. If Line of Sight is drawn through a space on a different Elevation that is not the space the target occupies, Line of Sight is blocked (See Example 1). \n\n• A figure on a higher Elevation may draw Line of Sight through and ignore all figures on a lower Elevation.\n\n• There are 4 levels of Elevation. 4 is the highest and 1 is the lowest. Figures may move between an Elevation change of 1 without penalty. For an Elevation change of 2, figures may move to the lower Elevation normally, but may not move back up to the higher Elevation. An Elevation change of 3 prevents a figure from moving to the higher Elevation, and a figure moving to the lower Elevation is Defeated. Figures with Flight may move between any Elevation change without penalty.\n\n• Figures on spaces next to each other that have an Elevation change of 1 or less are considered 'Adjacent', meaning, they can be Attacked by Melee () Attacks. \n\n• Figures with Reach may target other figures at an Elevation change of X or less equal to Reach (X). Meaning, a figure with Reach 2 could target a figure at an Elevation change of 2 or less. (Since they're making a Melee Attack at 2 spaces away.) Additionally, figures with Reach may target figures up to X spaces away, minus the difference of the Elevations change. \n\n***Example:*** A figure with Reach 2 could target a figure at two spaces away so long as the Elevation difference between them was only 1. \n\n• Ranged () Attacks may be made at any Elevation change as long as the requirements of Line of Sight are met.  \n\nExample 1:  \nNightingale wants to Attack the Cave Sickle that is at Elevation 1. Since she’s on the edge of the higher Elevation (3), she has Line of Sight and can make the Attack.

            "Formatted FAQ": "### How does Reach and Flanking Work? \nSo long as you're attacking an opponent while there is also another ally who is also within Melee Range of your target and on the opposite side or corner of that same target, you Gain the Flanking bonus. \n\nBelow are some diagrams to help explain this better:\n\n1. In this Diagram, Remi has Reach 2 and is within 2 spaces of the Animate. This means she is within Range to make a Melee Attack. If she does, she will Gain the Flanking bonus since Rook is also within Melee range of the Animate and also on the opposite side of the Animate.\n2. If both Rook and Remi had Reach 2, they could both get the Flanking bonus against the Animate so long as both figures were in Melee range and on opposite sides of the target. \n3. Even though Rook and Remi could still make an Attack at Reach 2, neither are attacking from opposite ends of the target. So, neither could gain the Flanking bonus since there is not a figure on opposite sides of the target. A way to visualize this is to draw an imaginary line between the center of each figure. If it is drawn through opposite corners of sides of the target, then you may Flank. The blue line here represents what that might look like. You can see that it does not draw through opposite sides of the target. Meanwhile, both Nightingale and Zeke could also Attack, but they would also not be considered Flanking.\n4. Remember, when determining if you can flank from a corner, another ally must be able to attack the same target from the opposite corner. In this case, both Zeke and Nightingale could now flank.\n5. You can even use Reach 2 to Flank targets diagonally. This gives you a ton of range!\n6. Keep in mind that Line of Sight is still taken into account. Friendly figures will impart a -1 to your ATK even when you use Reach. However, since you are still within Melee Range of the target, you still get your Flanking bonus. \n7. However, if an opponent was in your way, or your Line of Sight was blocked, you could not make an Attack, even with Reach. This means that other figures that would require you to be within Melee Range would also not be able to Flank.\n8. Flanking only requires that another ally on the opposite side of the target could also make a Melee Attack. This works the same with Large Based Combatants too. Reach simply expands your Melee Range. This means that the larger the base of the target you’re trying to flank, the more spots there are to flank from! \n9. Like the previous ***Example***, you can see that being on opposite sides of a target and within Melee Range is all it takes to flank! The blue line is again drawn here to show that both Remi and Rook are attacking from opposite sides. In the case of the larger figure, this has given them more room to work with as each side is bigger.\n10. This means that with larger bases, you can easily get more models into position. In this ***Example***, all four figures are in flanking positions! \n11. Remember to keep an eye out for more creative flanking positions!\n",
