For these reasons, we've decided to expand upon Gigas Grip in the same way we did Summoning. Future printings of Gigas Grip will say: \"Passive: You Gain Gigas Grip.\" Then, we will expand upon what the Gigas Grip Tag does for you. This will allow us to fit all the intricacies required by using the Rule Book instead of trying to jam it all onto a single mini card.\n\n***Gigas Grip (Tag):*** Thematically, Gigas Grip allows you to dual wield larger ***Melee*** Weapons. In addition to the normal rules for equipping gear, Adventurer's with this tag may equip 2-handed (***Melee***) or (***Melee/Ranged***) Weapons as if they were 1-handed. If they do, the following rules apply:\n\n* While equipped, 2-Handed Weapons still count as 2-Handed Weapons for the purpose of other abilities that might reference them. \n* These equipped 2-Handed Weapons weapons must still adhere to the normal Range Icon restrictions when equipping Items. (***Example:*** Both can be Melee, one can be Melee and the other Melee/Ranged, or both may have the Melee/Ranged. So, for example, you could equip a 1-handed shield and a 2-handed Melee or Melee/Ranged weapon. Or, you could equip a 1-handed Ranged Weapon and a 2-handed Melee Weapon.)\n* You may still equip 1-Handed Weapons of any type following all the rules associated with equipping weapons normally. (***Example:*** You could equip a 1-Handed Ranged Weapon and a 2-Handed Melee/Ranged Weapon. But it's important to remember that Gigas Grip ***doesn't*** allow you to equip a 2-Handed Ranged weapon as if it was 1-Handed.)\n* While equipped, you gain access to all Abilities printed on both equipped Weapons including Abilities printed on Upgrades equipped on both cards. \n* When Attacking, you must choose which Combat Dice to use. This can be any combination of two dice printed across either of your Equipped Weapons. A Weapon with the BLACK must add the BLACK. If one Equipped Weapon has a different Range or an Ability that might augment the Range of an Attack, (Such as Reach 2 or Range 4), then you must use the lowest Range available to both weapons. (***Example:*** If one Weapon has Reach 2 and the other does not, you may only Attack figures on Adjacent spaces. Alternatively, if one figure has Range 4 and the other has Range 6, you may only make Attacks against figures at Range 4. Lastly, if you have a Reach 2 Weapon and a Melee/Ranged Weapon with Range 4 you could make Melee Attacks against adjacent figures only since the Range on the Melee/Ranged Weapon applies to Ranged Attacks only.) \n* If at any time you Equip a Weapon that you would not be able to Equip with Gigas Grip (or otherwise), you must immediately end your current Actions and Abilities (if they are currently taking an Action or Ability). Then, Un-equip weapons so that your weapon selection is legal. (This might happen if you used an ability that flipped a 2-handed Melee weapon into a 2-handed Ranged weapon. Since you cannot have a 2-handed Ranged weapon equipped with any other weapon.)\n\n**Note to the community:** We've had a discussion amongst ourselves and wanted to reach out to the community about Gigas Grip solutions. We have a much more complex way of doing it, but felt that the above ruling covered all the bases. Our only concern is if it is abusable or too powerful. Please let us know. If we must, we can revert it back to choosing which weapon you attack with, but this fix is wordy and a bit more difficult to explain. \n "

            "Description": "## How does Reach and Flanking Work? \nSo long as you're attacking an opponent while there is also another ally who is also within Melee Range of your target and on the opposite side or corner of that same target, you Gain the Flanking bonus. \n\nBelow are some diagrams to help explain this better:\n\n1. In this Diagram, Remi has Reach 2 and is within 2 spaces of the Animate. This means she is within Range to make a Melee Attack. If she does, she will Gain the Flanking bonus since Rook is also within Melee range of the Animate and also on the opposite side of the Animate.\n2. If both Rook and Remi had Reach 2, they could both get the Flanking bonus against the Animate so long as both figures were in Melee range and on opposite sides of the target. \n3. Even though Rook and Remi could still make an Attack at Reach 2, neither are attacking from opposite ends of the target. So, neither could gain the Flanking bonus since there is not a figure on opposite sides of the target. A way to visualize this is to draw an imaginary line between the center of each figure. If it is drawn through opposite corners of sides of the target, then you may Flank. The blue line here represents what that might look like. You can see that it does not draw through opposite sides of the target. Meanwhile, both Nightingale and Zeke could also Attack, but they would also not be considered Flanking.\n4. Remember, when determining if you can flank from a corner, another ally must be able to attack the same target from the opposite corner. In this case, both Zeke and Nightingale could now flank.\n5. You can even use Reach 2 to Flank targets diagonally. This gives you a ton of range!\n6. Keep in mind that Line of Sight is still taken into account. Friendly figures will impart a -1 to your ATK even when you use Reach. However, since you are still within Melee Range of the target, you still get your Flanking bonus. \n7. However, if an opponent was in your way, or your Line of Sight was blocked, you could not make an Attack, even with Reach. This means that other figures that would require you to be within Melee Range would also not be able to Flank.\n8. Flanking only requires that another ally on the opposite side of the target could also make a Melee Attack. This works the same with Large Based Combatants too. Reach simply expands your Melee Range. This means that the larger the base of the target you’re trying to flank, the more spots there are to flank from! \n9. Like the previous example, you can see that being on opposite sides of a target and within Melee Range is all it takes to flank! The blue line is again drawn here to show that both Remi and Rook are attacking from opposite sides. In the case of the larger figure, this has given them more room to work with as each side is bigger.\n10. This means that with larger bases, you can easily get more models into position. In this example, all four figures are in flanking positions! \n11. Remember to keep an eye out for more creative flanking positions!\n",

So long as your equipment loadout is legal, nothing is amiss. Otherwise, you'd have to immediately un-equip until your loadout is legal. It's also possible to equip a 2-Handed Ranged Weapon and a Flintlock due to the fact that the Flintlock can make it a Melee Weapon while flipped. In this case, so long as you don't flip the Flintlock back, you could legally equip the Flintlock with another 2-Handed Ranged Weapon (a Bow for example.) using Gigas Grip since the 2-handed Ranged Weapon is considered a Melee Weapon while equipped with the Flintlock in it's flipped position. However, the Melee Symbol means that the paired weapon no longer has a Ranged Value. Thus, both the Flintlock and the paired 2-Handed Ranged Weapon (now made a 2-Handed Melee Weapon) couldn't make Attacks beyond Melee Range.  \n\nWhile there might be a valid build using a 2-Handed Ranged Weapon-made-melee, it seems more viable (and simpler) to combine the Flintlock with a 2-Handed Melee/Ranged Weapon. That way, regardless of what side you flipped it too you could have it equipped. \n\nFunctionally, Gigas Grip isn't required for the above ruling. This FAQ could also be made about equipping the Flintlock with another 1-handed Melee/Ranged Weapon. While you can equip it with either a 1-Handed Ranged or 1-Handed Melee, only one side of the Flintlock is compatible.

Since it is not, she can make the attack here. However, neither figure is considered Adjacent.\n3. Remi has Reach 2 and is on Elevation 3. The Animate does not have Reach and is below her on Elevations 1. Since the difference is 2, Remi is glad to have Reach 2, which allows her to make a Melee Attack. Meanwhile, the Animate is in trouble and could not Attack back. This also means that it could not Counter. Additionally, neithern figure could make Break Attacks since neither figure is considered Adjacent to each other and Reach does not expand Remi's Range for Break Attacks. (Provoke 2 would.)  \n4. Even though Remi has Reach 2, she cannot Attack the Animate at one space away. The difference in Elevation is 2 and the Animate is 1 space further away. To make this Melee Attack, Remi would need Reach 3 or use a Ranged Attack or Spell.",
