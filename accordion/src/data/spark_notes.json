At first he plays coy, but after hearing that Aisling almost got them killed by setting fire to the murder scene he drops the act and goes deadly serious. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Remi begins threatening that she\u2019ll go to Malik and Grace if he doesn\u2019t cooperate, but it\u2019s unneeded. Padric shushes them all down before ushering them into the back of the Inn where they can talk in private.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">With slumped shoulders, and a promise that they wouldn\u2019t go to Grace or Malik, Padric explains. The Black Hand are criminals, and Padric hated that Grace was working to any capacity with them. He worried that Grace knew about Malik\u2019s treachery and was okay with it it so long as it furthered her own ends and helped Rhamsted prosper financially to make her look good to the other royalty. Padric probably could have looked the other way in either case, but when Aisling came to town, everything changed. Padric and Aisling wanted to stop Malik, and to uncover his criminal activities to Balthazar, to Kezia, to Grace, or to anyone who would listen. But as they searched for proof that would damn either Malik or Grace, Aisling got out of hand. She got the idea that Grace was as guilty as Malik. As Aisling\u2019s past came to light, Padric worried that their schemes had escalated from bringing justice to Malik, to getting revenge on him and anyone else turning a blind eye. Aisling became increasingly more violent as time had gone on. And the fight between Padric and Aisling that they stumbled on early was Padric telling Aisling he didn\u2019t want anything to do with it anymore. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Zeke defends his cousin by pointing out that Grace might not know about Malik\u2019s criminal activity. While Padric hopes that\u2019s the case, the possibility has always been the reason why neither he nor Aisling could simply go to the authorities or Grace herself. If they were wrong, it could mean trouble for both of them.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">As Padric talked, Remi looked increasingly uncomfortable at the extent of her father\u2019s criminal activities being talked about in such a public setting. She couldn\u2019t help but feel that being a good father wasn\u2019t the same as being a good person. And somewhere, deep down, she was having a hard time believing that he could so such horrible things. \u00a0</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Rook and Nightingale demanded to know more. So Padric sighed, and with a look towards Remi, he continued. Without going into too much detail, Padric explained that Aisling\u2019s lost her dad back on Earth and that Malik was directly responsible for his death.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Remi couldn\u2019t believe what she was hearing. Her father was a murderer too? That wasn\u2019t possible. He was always so nice to her and everything he\u2019d always done was out of love.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Remi spoke up, defending her father but was cut short by Padric as he explained that Remi didn\u2019t know her father very well. She had only been on Middara for less than three years and Padric could assure her that Malik was far from an upstanding person, good father or not. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Remi sulked, angry and conflicted at all the new feelings washing over her. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Padric continued. He admitted that his actions weren\u2019t out of altruism, revenge, or any other need to see Grace and Malik imprisoned. He just loved Aisling and got fired up by her fervor. But when things got out of hand he failed to convince her to let it go. If it wasn\u2019t for what the group had just told Padric he wouldn\u2019t have even believe that Aisling was behind the murder that happened to the information broker. But if the information broker really died in such a spectacular fashion, it could only mean one thing. Their plan worked and Aisling was able to steal the Hegemonix.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The mention of the \u2018Hegemonix\u2019 piques Rooks interest as he confirms to Padric that the Hegemonix was missing at the house. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Padric elaborates. The Hegemonix was a magical puzzle box from Arkalla, dangerous and capable of calling down exalted espers. They\u2019re plan was to steal an artifact as proof for the King. It was likely that Asiling went to steal the artifact and got caught, then used it to kill the information broker. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">Padric claims he has to end this, and he can\u2019t let Aisling hurt anyone else. He doesn\u2019t trust going to the authorities, but he wants to help them find what they need from the information broker and apprehend Aisling. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The group agrees, but Remi protests against the idea of helping everyone imprison her own father, but after some emotional support from Nightingale, Remi agrees to help in any other way she can.</span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">They spend the night at Padric\u2019s Dragon Arms for free once again, bathing and resting. They would need to be prepared if they were going to stop Aisling. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; color: #000000;\">The next morning, as the group prepares to depart, Padric arrives, geared up and ready to join them. After finally being asking why he\u2019s always so helpful, Padric comes clean and tells them that he personally knows Shayliss Arsen. If anything were to happen to Nightingale, Shayliss\u2019 older sister might literally kill him. While there is clearly some unexplained history there, the conviction in his voice is enough for Nightingale to believe in the authenticity of the claim. </span></li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Excited to finally depart and get the information they need, Nightingale asks for a discount on gear before they depart.

He had feelings for Aisling, but he knew that what transpired wasn\u2019t Remi\u2019s fault.

The foster mother died, she was the one who knew about the existence of Middara and the father isn\u2019t going to just give his daughter away to strangers. At this point, the Harbingers are at a stand-still short of breaking into the house and kidnapping the girl. And as any \u201cPrincess of Elenia\u201d would know, this is avoided at all cost. They\u2019ve decided to sit on it to see if the situation changes.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale tells Lyle that due to her status, she has private Harbingers in the city of Elenia that she could recruit for the job and make it happen.

Suri angrily explains that Isla was stupid and endangered the man she Soul Bonded with. Suri doesn\u2019t blame Rook for their failure to save Isla, she blames Isla for her recklessness that got herself and someone she loved killed.

The whole thing was very puzzling. On top of that, she had a large book with her that confusingly could not be separated from her.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The worst part is that the explosion was so large that it blew holes into parts of the mines shaft that had been closed off due to monster infestations.

The girl only cowers at his rage, scooting farther into the back of her cell. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale intervenes and takes a different approach to the interrogation. She had a hunch that this jailed girl was the Theodotion mage they\u2019d been looking for. Assuming such, Nightingale tells the girl that she is infected with a horrible parasite called the Maluma and she believes that Theodotion is the only way to save her.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the mention of Theodotion, the girl becomes receptive. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The occupant of the cell wearlily introduces herself to Nightingale as Justice Bouchard. She asks Nightingale how she knows that she can use Theodotion. Nightingale tells Justice the truth.

Justice tells them that she was in the mines with her friends and they were looking for something when they were attacked by Blighted Guardians being controlled by humans. The explosion was in self defense. She apologized profusely.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook asks if the explosion has something to do with how dangerous Theodotion is, Justice nods. She confirms that controlling such a magic is difficult, and the power that was unleashed was a mistake that was goated out of self preservations. The humans after them weren\u2019t going to let her live otherwise. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles interjects and demands to know who and where her friends are. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice\u2019 face twists in agony. She tears up as she explains that they died in the ambush. They weren\u2019t the only ones looking in the Mines. Now they\u2019re all dead. The humans controlling the Blighted Guardians killed them. When she was finally cornered, she used her magic to save her own life. She killed the people who attacked them.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice seems genuinely hurt over what had transpired. Damocles shows her no remorse. Instead, he only scoffs and questions her more. The fact that Blighted Guardians were involved meant that this was connected to the attack on his estate and the infection of his mother. Damocles asks Justice if she knows anything more about the Blighted Guardians and explains what happened at his estate.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice confirms that she thinks she knows where the cages were kept that held them. She claims that there is a sort of operation deep within the mines where the Blighted creatures are being studied. Justice also claims that if they free her, she might be able to help with Maluma issue afterwards. She can\u2019t cure Nightingale, but she knows who might be able too.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice quickly makes a deal with Nightingale and Damocles. If they let her go free, she will lead the party down to where she saw the Blighted Guardians in cages and guide Nightingale to the acquaintance she claims can help remove the Maluma.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles reluctantly agrees only after Nightingale presses him on the issue.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Party Member:</span> Justice Bouchard.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unable to overcome the infestation of monsters in the hidden tunnel, the party retreats and makes their way back to the Hyde manor\u2019s gate.

For these reasons, the guards assume that Nightingale and the others must be the help from Elenia that they sent for.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The guards let them pass and lead the group to the main room of the Hyde manor where a man waits for them.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias Hyde welcomes them, and has them take a seat before introducing himself. Elias looks worn and his face droops in misery. Behind the expensive clothing and jewelry, it\u2019s clear that something is wrong. Before Nightingale can inquire, another man appears, and \u00a0Elias introduces the man as his son, Damocles.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles is intimidating, apprehensive, and tall. He sits nearby and suspiciously stares at the party.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeke and Nightingale track down Teegan Patel to tell her their fabricated story.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeke exclaims that the Corpse collector bested them and they were unable to snag the Lotus.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale chimes in and explains that Lyle didn\u2019t trust them anyway. Nightingale then promises that she will see what she can do about the situation once she gets back to Elenia.

The crater from the explosion that took place was huge and left a chasm that stretched across the underground in a way that was unreal.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the others take in the horrific sight, Justice begins searching for something immediately upon arrival. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Justice pokes at dark corners in her search, Nightingale pulls herself away from the traces of human still littering the crater to ask Justice more about what happened.

He turns and asks Justice to confirm that by the Grim Deacons, she means the same Grim Deacons that are well known as very talented Brahmanian Spies and soldiers.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice nods, confirming that Rook is spot on in his analysis. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles overhears and worries at the news. He\u2019s heard of the Grim Deacons. They\u2019re notorious elite killers for the aristocracies of Brahma, the country to the west. They\u2019re hard to kill, and incredibly connected. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice turns to explain that the Grim Deacons are after the friend she wants to take Nightingale too. His name is Zafir and he\u2019s likely to be able to help them out with the Maluma issue. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The mention of Grim Deacons causes Rook to become increasingly more wary.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice reassured them that the Grim Deacons were caught in the blast and makeup half of the bodies here. So there is no need to worry. She seems confident that the blast killed all three of them although there was a fourth individual who did not look like a Grim Deacon but instead looked like a resident of Hyde.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles goes to ask more about the fourth man but Justice mentions he ran off into a nearby tunnel that has collapsed. She\u2019s certain it\u2019s where they needed to go.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, and with a triumphant gasp, Justice finds what she and her friends were after. She holds up an irregular white rock in the corner of the room and laughs triumphantly. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles swipes the rock from Justice and curiously asks what it is.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice calls it a pontifex. Or\u2026 at least part of one. It\u2019s something Zafir was after. She explains that she doesn\u2019t know what it does exactly, they were on orders from Zafir to get it for him.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something stirs inside Nightingale, the Maluma thunders inside her mind. It yearns for the Pontifex piece and part of its feelings impart upon Nightingale and she too feels the need for this artifact.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale, in a trance-like state of submission to the Maluma, snatches the Pontifex piece from Damocles. Nightingale claims that she\u2019s the Princess of Elenia and this belongs to her before anyone else present in the mines. Nightingale says that she\u2019ll keep watch of the Pontifex piece until Justice\u2019s end of the bargain is fulfilled. Then, she\u2019ll give it to Zafir only if she deems that it\u2019s safe.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Story Item:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> First Piece of the Pontifex.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Damocles and Justice seem bummed about Nightingale\u2019s decision for different reasons but they both submit to it being fair. Nightingale is the Princess of Elenia after all. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles asks if everyone is ready to continue towards where the fourth man ran off too. They agree, and Justice leads them to the collapsed section she mentioned earlier. After a short moment the group is able to squeeze themselves into a tight corridor. The party continues down the corridor a very long way until they finally reach a thick locked stone door.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles suggests that Justice cause another explosion to blow through the door but Justice refuses, saying that anytime she uses her Theodotion magic, a price must be paid to her Tome. Confused, Damocles simply accepts the answer without further explanation.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just then, Remi leans in, hearing voices on the other side of the door.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group hear two different people talking, a man and a woman. The woman is furious with the man for failing to kill \u201cthe Duke and his heir\u201d. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The man assures the woman by the name of Echo that Elias\u2019 infected wife will soon \u201cturn\u201d. Nobody survives the Blight, and Rivka will be no different. Elias will not have the willpower to execute his own wife and will thus become infected himself. The plan is all coming together.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frustrated. Echo responds to the man by the name of Hendrix. She\u2019s furious with Hendrix\u2019s lack of initiative. Echo suggests they infect Hyde\u2019s water system with The Blight. She explains that if they can uproot the city, Brahmanian plans can move forward with occupation.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From listening to the two voices talk, It seemed a Grim Deacon by the name of Echo is conspiring with someone by the name of Hendrix.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles knew Hendrix. And hearing the man plot the demise of Hyde and his family drove Damocles\u2019 face white with anger. Enough was enough, Damocles angrily orders Justice to use her magic to blast their way through. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confronted with his anger, Justice reconsiders using her magic. She channels energy from her giant book and focuses it on the stone door. The door rots away as if time itself was destroying it. After the door shrivels, there\u2019s an explosion of dust as the passage before them explodes.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the dust and madness, the party makes out what\u2019s behind the door. It looks like a primitive laboratory of some sort with cages and vials and syringes and experiments of all sorts. The explosion caused by Justice sent the equipment scattering and the room was now a mess.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Echo and Hendrix were now clearly visible.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles had always seen Hendrix as one of his fathers best friends. He had always trusted Hendrix to protect Hyde. Instead, Damocles finds him conspiring with a Grim Deacon and the culprit behind his mother\u2019s impending demise.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This betrayal sends Damocles into a blind rage. He charges into the room as the debris and dust still settles. He makes a lunge to tackle Hendrix.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fed up with Hendrix\u2019s incompetency, Echo grabs a sketchy looking syringe off of a table and injects Hendrix with its contents.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hendrix immediately starts pustulating and turning pale. He screams at the realization he\u2019s been infected with such a pure form of the Blight. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before anyone can stop Echo, she disappears into the far exit and escapes through a door. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, Damocles tries to get information from Hendrix, but it\u2019s too late. The man\u2019s form twists into something inhuman and he screams in pain as he\u2019s turned into something horrible. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles wants the Grim Deacon called Echo to pay for her involvement in his mother\u2019s death. Angry and out for revenge, Damocles arrives with packs ladened with gear as the party is turning to leave Hyde. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice explains that the Swamps of Gehenna are incredibly dangerous. She cautions Damocles on his choice to join the party but he isn\u2019t deterred.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles explains that he isn\u2019t going to rest until he avenges his mother and finds and \u00a0uncovers every detail. Damocles vows to punish everyone who was involved in the plot of Rivka\u2019s murder and the threat to Hyde. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Together, the group begins to head out of the city.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Party Member:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Damocles joins the party.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>Flag Check:</span> Depending on your flags, continue to the appropriate scene.</li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remi and Rook win the Bellicose fight. Jovial trash-talking ensues.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team journeys further into the wooded mountains and approached the Corpse Pond. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All along the way Padric urged them to turn back. He feels like this is a terrible idea and explains that Corpse Collectors get their names for a reason\u2026 They collect corpses.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That becomes all too apparent as they reach a clearing where the pond is located. Sure enough, there are bodies floating all around. Most are clearly animal parts, but others look more human in origin. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the center of the pond floated an exquisite golden flower surrounded by a mysterious glowing mist. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having seen ponds like this before, Padric says that they may be in luck if they stay on this side of the lake. Hopefully, The Corpse Collector may already be dead.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While walking around Hyde, a woman recognizes Nightingale and frantically runs up to her.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zeke jokes that their plans of falsifying their identities has already failed.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The woman introduces herself as Teegan Patel. She invites the party to dinner and explains that the Patel family is close friends with the Hyde\u2019s. She even seems know both Nightingale\u2019s and Zeke\u2019s parent\u2019s personally.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoping that Teegan Patel can be convinced not to blow their cover, Rook and the others agree to go out to dinner with her.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teegan leads them to a hole-in-the-wall rice ball joint and they sit down for what Teegan claims are the best rice balls in all of Elenia. During dinner, the group learns that Teegan and her husband were with Elias Hyde and both Zeke and Nightingale\u2019s parents when Elenia was founded. Impressed, Rook wants to know more about her past but is cut short when Teegan reveals that she needs Nightingale\u2019s help.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teegan explains that she has a daughter on Earth. Apparently, her daughter\u2019s foster mother died and the father refused to give her up to the Harbingers when they came from Middara to get her. Teegan pleads with Nightingale to use her status as a princess to petition the Hyde Harbinger contingent to try and collect her daughter a second time, this time, making sure that her daughter is forced to come to Middara.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group has mixed opinions on forcing someone from Earth to give up their child against their will, but ultimately they agree to help in hopes that Teegan will return the favor.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>Reward:</span> It looks like you have some leftovers!</li>", "<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team goes to a tavern called \u201cThe Brass Lantern\u201d to play some Abraxis Battle Dice. Hopefully they get some sweet loot!</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The clearing where the pond was located was one of the greenest and most serene places the team had ever seen.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just in the distance was the infamous Corpse Pond, staying true to the name. Bloated corpses of both animals and what looked like people were shriveled and floating just above the surface of the water.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the center of the pond floated an exquisite golden flower. It seemed easy enough to swim in and grab, although the murky water surrounding it was daunting to say the least.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wanting to get it over with, Zeke jumps in to snag the Lotus. He quickly noticed how numbingly cold the water is.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before he can get any closer, Zeke realizes he is surrounded by a pack of amphibious dog-like creatures and swears as he fumbles for his weapon. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padric shows the group his favorite place to swim on the coast of Elenia. The group settles down and are able to relax a bit on the beach. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padric makes sure to do what he can to let the group blow off steam. He makes a fire pit to cook food and cracks open some drinks he brought along from his own establishment. Everyone drinks Padric\u2019s beers and eats his famous kabobs.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The warm sun feels good, and the group is able to forget about some of the horrors they witnessed, if only for a moment.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the celebration, Padric pours a beer out for Aisling, and silently pays his respect to his dead friend.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group retreats in the direction Echo had ran off to as Hendrix begins to overwhelm them.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once through the door, Justice screams and uses her magic again to collapse the tunnel behind them to prevent Hendrix from making a pursuit. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Exhausted from using her magic, Justice allows herself to be supported as the group follows after the direction that Echo went. Through the door they find a long corridor. Not long later they find themselves overlooking the city of Hyde from a hidden entrance in the hill side.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles thanks the group for their help. Even though they were unable to kill Hendrix, they were able to gather all the information they need to inform Elias of Hendrix\u2019s collusion with the Grim Deacons.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond the monsters and other horrific creatures beneath the Hyde Estate, the party travels deeper into the tunnels until they come upon a solid piece of metal seated against the stone wall at the end of a tight tunnel. The group squeezes forward and push against the metal until it opens spilling the group into a dark room. Looking around, they realize that they are inside of a cellar. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Believing that this has to be the Hyde Estate, Rook begins to worry that this tunnel was either an old escape tunnel for the royalty, or it was dug for a more nefarious purpose. The group isn\u2019t able to theorize as a crash and a yell nearby signals to the group that they\u2019ve been discovered by someone inside of the cellar. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inside the cellar is a tall angry looking man with red eyes and a flowing purple cloak. Seeing the group come out of a hidden tunnel inside of the Cellar, the man accuses them as intruders in his house and criminals who are behind a recent attack on his Estate. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group tries to explain why they\u2019re inside of his but the man cuts them off with a shout. He accuses them of infecting his mother with some sort of disease before angrily reaching out with magic and summoning a pair of Espers to aid him. The three them move to engage in a fight with who they are convinced are violent intruders.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias leads the party into his estate to discuss the matters at hand. As they walk, Elias explains that he\u2019s be waiting a long time for the requested help from Elenia to arrive. He didn\u2019t know that the princess of Elenia herself would be the one they\u2019d send to help him. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale only smiles, keeping up the lie and hoping Elias explains more without her having to ask any questions. Luckily, he does.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias then explains his perils and informs the party of a sort of disease that is spreading within the city \u00a0of Hyde called The Blight.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People infected with The Blight devolve into mindless, bloodthirsty monsters called Blighted Guardians. Recently, everything came to a dramatic head when a Blighted Guardian found its way into the Hyde Estate during the night and attack Elias\u2019 wife Rivka.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias explains solemnly that Rivka is not doing well. As he begins to point out the severity and declining health of his wife Elias is unable to finish the sentence as despair overtakes him.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His son, Damocles, steps forward and tells the party about a Blighted Guardian that had broken into their house and attacked his mother Rivka and infected her with The Blight. They didn\u2019t know how it got in previously, but with the discovery of the tunnels they found, it was clear that it came from beyond the entrance and in the cellar where the party fell from. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This confirms that the entrance found was unknown to the Hyde family. Rook is relieved, their discovery was more important than he could have imagined. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook expresses his knowledge about The Blight to his friends. It\u2019s well known that there is no cure and anyone infected by the horrific disease meets a terrible end. Rook knows that Rivka likely doesn\u2019t have long before she is turned into a Blighted Guardian herself.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias confirms Rook\u2019s concern and let\u2019s them all know that this investigation must be done with discretion in mind. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both Damocles and Elias suspect foul play behind the recent surge of Blighted victims in Hyde. Especially now that they discovered those hidden tunnels, it\u2019s likely that whoever was behind their construction is directly behind the recent outbreak and Rivka\u2019s infection. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles adds that there was an incident in the mines a few days prior. Not long after the attack on their estate and Rivka\u2019s infection, there was an explosion in the mines. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br>\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles suspects that this explosion has something to do with whoever is behind all this madness.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias asks Nightingale and the others to help them find and apprehend the individuals responsible for building the tunnels and the explosion in the mines. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before they can leave, Elias pauses to look at Nightingale softly. Elias reminds her that he\u2019s the King\u2019s appointed duke in Hyde. He served Balthazar faithfully and helped explore these wildlands before this town even existed. He\u2019s happy to see the Princess herself stepping up to help the Hyde family in their time of need. Her friends were even recommended by Shayliss Arsen herself.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias then promises to keep her safe. He appoints Damocles to accompany them and to get ot the bottom of the events that are transpiring.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not wanting to give her cover away, Nightingale only smiles and thanks Elias. However, she wonders who Shayliss had originally intended to send as the help.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles promises to not let his father down and then briskly moves passed the group. Waving a hand for them to follow.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Story Flag:</span> Elias\u2019s Gratitude.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While exploring Hyde, the party comes across the Hyde Bellicose Arena. The Bellicose Arena is a popular sport on Middara that pitches teams against each other in battle. Luckily, a magical item called a Bellicose Cube keeps participants from serious harm while also allowing them to not hold back.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After bantering about their favorite Bellicose teams and some famous matches in Middaran history, the group is urged by Padric to play a match. The group excitedly decide to blow off some steam by engaging in some good old fashioned combat with each other.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Padric pairs the Zeke and Nightingale up and then pitches the royalty against their friends.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The corpse of Hendrix Patel sits in a collapsed heap on the ground. Damocles expresses how important the Patel family had been to the prosperity of Hyde. He still couldn\u2019t believe that they\u2019d betray them like this. To conspire with Grim Deacons was treason. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice stammers in confusion. She swears that the Grim Deacon Hendrix was with, the one he called Echo, was killed in the initial blast that brought them to the mines in the first place. Justice even claims that she saw her crumpled destroyed body torn to bits. There was no way she could have survived her magical blast that tore down the mines.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale finds herself continually looking towards Justice\u2019s spell book. Somewhere inside that incredible source of power might be the cure she needed. Nightingale presses the party to take a look around so that they can get out of these mines.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The party begins feverish searching the laboratory for clues as to how to Blight can be cured. Unfortunately, all the books in the lab seemed to be instruction manuals on how to spread disease, not cure it. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After digging through the books for hours, they decide to pile them up on the body of Hendrix and burn the remains.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group follows after the direction that Echo went. Through the door they find a long corridor. Not long later they find themselves overlooking the city of Hyde from a hidden entrance in the hill side.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles thanks the group for their help and together they decide to inform Elias of Hendrix\u2019s collusion with the Grim Deacons.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Story Flag:</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> An End to Madness.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The deception works and Zeke and the others feign their confidence with the guards. Unknown to them, it seems that the guards were apparently already awaiting \u00a0a group of adventurers. Under the impression that they are the hired help sent for from the capital of the City of Elenia, the guards let them into the Hyde Estate. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The team is ushered into Elias\u2019 quarters to discuss the supposed issue at hand. The group keeps their calm, hoping that they aren\u2019t supposed to know too much about the issue at hand.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After entering, the team keeps up the facade, telling all the guards and Elias Hyde himself that they are seasoned adventurers sent from Elenia to help with Elias\u2019 still unknown situation.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias welcomes them, and has them take a seat before introducing himself. Elias looks worn and his face droops in misery. Behind the expensive clothing and jewelry, it\u2019s clear that something is wrong. Before Nightingale can inquire, another man appears, and \u00a0Elias introduces the man as his son, Damocles.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles is intimidating, apprehensive, and tall. He sits nearby and stares at the party as the four continue to expand upon their lie of being the hired help that the Hyde family sent for.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elias exclaims that he\u2019s be waiting a long time for help from Elenia to arrive.

He explains that in the same timeframe that his wife was attacked, there was an explosion in the mines of Hyde.

Elias tells Nightingale that his wife is none of their concern. Instead, he only requires that they worry about the mine and catch those who are responsible for this attack on a royal family. Elias sternly reminds them that he\u2019s the King\u2019s appointed duke. He served Balthazar faithfully and helped explore these wildlands before this town even existed. He feels that he is owed some assistance, and they were recommended by the first Princess, Shayliss Arsen herself. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale agrees, not wanting to give her cover away.

Damocles is flustered and confused, he turns and asks his father why he should stop from punishing those breaking into their house. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">His father introduces himself as Elias Hyde and apologizes, helping Nightingale to her feet. He chastises Damocles for attacking without thinking. Unlike him, Elias had recognized the second Princess of Elenia, Nightingale Arsen. Elias explains to Damocles that killing a Princess of Elenia would do them no favors. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles apologizes and turns to help the rest to their feet. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale and the others explain that they are from Elenia and on an important mission. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing the princess in his cellar, Elias Hyde mistakenly believes that Nightingale and her friends must be the official help that his family fetched for from Elenia. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale and the others don\u2019t know about any sort of official requested help from the capital, but they nod anyway, playing along. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving Isla from the Celestial Gigas proves to be a double-edged sword. Due to the amount of time spent fighting, the doctor isn\u2019t able to save Faust and he dies in the hospital.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overtaken with grief, Isla storms out of the Hyde hospital and disappears into Hyde.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group turns their attention back to the task at hand, hoping that Isla will be okay.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>New Story Flag:</span> Heartbroken Exile.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Justice assures the party that they are almost to the explosion site. She apologizes for the infestation of creatures and explains that while the presence of many are directly her fault for opening up the walls, the Blighted Guardians shouldn\u2019t have been down here regardless. The human\u2019s she ran into were likely behind the presence of the Blighted Guardians. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They finally reach the wide cavern that Justice had been leading them toward.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook hopes that all the death they\u2019ve been dealing will have thinned out the infestation and help the guards in the future.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles thanks them again for their help and hopes that all this work can save his mother.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles chauffeurs the party down from the manor and into the streets of Hyde.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unbeknownst to the Nightingale and her friends, Damocles has researched the real adventuring party from Elenia that was supposed to arrive and give aid in Hyde. They were supposed to be seafaring pirates lead by a large man named Kajax.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles knows their story is fake and angrily confronts Nightingale while out of the earshot of his father. Damocles demands to know who they really are and what they want from him and his father.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale is forced to tell the truth as the tension peaks. Damocles is hot headed, and Rook worries that a fight might break loose. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles is calmed down when Nightingale admits who she is and why she\u2019s there. She catches Damocles up briefly, then explains that they are looking for a Theodotion mage.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles chastises them for lying to him and his father. Regardless, he feels that their intentions are genuine. Damocles figures that as long as they are willing to help him with his mother\u2019s situation and find the true culprit behind The Blight, he doesn\u2019t care why they are here. More importantly, Damocles explains that he knows nothing of a Theodotion mage. However, if this fabled Theodotion was powerful enough to collapse a large section of the Hyde Mines, then it may be related to the explosion that occurred a few days ago.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale begins to inquire to learn more, but Damocles cuts her short and explains that they\u2019re going to see the jailer. He tells Nightingale that her questions would be better asked there. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apparently, Damocles already has a lead that none of them know about. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now back at the embassy, with Lotus in hand, the party debates on what to do with this sought-after flower.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remi has heard about the corpse lotus before. A corpse lotus in pristine condition like the one they\u2019d just retrieved would garner them a handsome return. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook and Zeke both agree. They think that the money would help the group ensure Nightingale\u2019s safety. Afterall, they needed money to make sure that they were properly equipped to get rid of the Maluma.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale can\u2019t believe that the others are considering taking the Lotus and selling it after promising Teegan Patel that they would help her. She contends that her daughter could have been told about Middara and could be waiting to come to Middara. Remi contends that she might not. Moreover, not everyone wants to be pulled away from their friends and family.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>Decision:</span> The Adventurer with the Corpse Lotus must decide what to do.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The party makes their way up a hill overlooking the city to the walled off Hyde estate. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the gates of the manor were two guards that looked more bored than threatening. The guards make it clear that no one is entering the gate behind them. Apparently, as they\u2019ve already been told, the Hyde family is not seeing visitors.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the others debate on how to approach the situation, Zeke takes charge and decides to attempt to lie his way in.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>!</b>Skill Check:</span> The rest of his friends play along and Zeke hopes it works.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Padric escorting Aisling to Elenia proper, Remi and Nightingale rest near a quiet pond and eat lunch. The two watch with enjoyment as Remi\u2019s new cat, Gage, plays on the pond\u2019s edge. The two debate on what Balthazar will do to Aisling as punishment for her crimes. Nightingale suspects the gallows but the outcome could change depending on her father\u2019s mood after his long memorial hunt.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale is confident that because herself, Remi, Zeke, and Rook made sure to defer to her father about Aisling\u2019s punishment, that Balthazar will be pleased. If she\u2019s lucky, her father might even reconsider allowing Nightingale into the Demiurge.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two eventually rejoin Rook and Zeke and they continue traveling towards Hyde.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles leads the group to the entrance of the mines. The guards eyeball Justice suspiciously and urge Damocles to be careful. Apparently, since the explosion, the mines were teeming with monsters.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles pulls Justice to the front and commands her to lead away. She tiptoes forward and leads the group cautiously into the dark.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The group continues on their way towards the city of Hyde in hopes of finding more information about the mythical Theodotion Mage mentioned in Aisling\u2019s stolen documents. As they travel south, and deeper into Elenia\u2019s wild countryside, they marvel at the vast mountainous and unforgiving terrain along the way.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the long walk, Rook tries to comfort Nightingale by suggesting that curing her of the Maluma could be as easy as casting a spell.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With hesitation and doubt in her voice, Nightingale tries to cheer herself up.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><b>! </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flag Check: </span></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Experienced Guide.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>!</strong> Reward Check: </span>Hegemonix.</li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a long, treacherous battle, the party stands exhausted, Isla dead at their feet.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faust, clinging to life, accepts Isla\u2019s fate, exclaiming that she won\u2019t be alone for long.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook does his best to help tend to Faust\u2019s devastating wounds but doesn\u2019t have much hope for Faust\u2019s survival.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rook asks Suri how Isla got to be on Middara to begin with. He\u2019d always been told that those from Arkalla couldn\u2019t take physical form for long. Suri explains that creatures from different dimensions can create a Soul Bond with each other, allowing them to travel freely between worlds. Faust was Isla\u2019s Soul Bond and this was highly illegal. Although this is usually safe, Suri\u2019s home world of Arkalla is one of the dimensions that is off limits from travel. The Great Bounty are the being that enforce this law and will surely be here soon.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Suri then notices a dark opening in the sky and dread overcomes her. The agents of The Great Bounty were already here.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dread overcomes Suri as a dark opening tears into the sky above them. An agent of the Great Bounty was already here. Suri wisps away, giving Rook one last desperate look before vanishing in fear at the newcomer.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Descending from the skies, a massive lion-like creature, three stories tall with flowing feathery wings like something out of the book of Revelations lands nearby.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beast introduces itself as an agent of the Great Bounty. Promising that it means humans no harm. Instead, the creature congratulates them for bringing it lawbreakers. First, it turns on the Living Oblation. The red headed girl with the scythe struggles with her injuries and crawls in a vain attempt to escape.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion-Beast leans down over the squirming Living Oblation. The red headed girl screams out as the Lion-Beast tears the human vessel into pieces, exposing the creature that was habitating the human body. It explodes out of the carcass like a black ooze, similar to the Maluma.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale covers her mouth in horror at the idea of the monster tearing her apart to get at the Maluma within herself. Somewhere deep within her, she feels the Maluma shrink and disappear as though it too was fearful of the monster.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lion-Beast is disappointed when he sees Isla\u2019s still dead body. The agent of the Great Bounty explains that they only offer payment for fugitives that are delivered alive. Then, he tosses a cloth sack filled with gold for their delivery of the Living Oblation. Finally, the Lion-beast tears open a pocket of reality itself, revealing a portal to some place far beyond. The Lion-beast nods to the party before walking through and snapping the portal shut behind him.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A messenger rushes to find Damocles and the others in the city. The message is urgent. Damocles must return to his father. Things are getting worse quickly for Rivka.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When they arrive to the estate, they find the servants all dressed in black. They are ushered to a bedroom where they find Elias sitting next to his wife, Rivka. The poor woman looks sick and pale with a green rot spreading down her body. There is a madness in her eyes and it\u2019s clear that she\u2019s no longer completely human. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though Damocles protests, Elias refuses to see his wife turn completely into a monster. Even if a cure does exist, he could never live with himself keeping her locked up for the decades it could take until the mythical cure is found.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The truth is horrific but they both realize what must be done. Rivka must be killed before things get worse.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Maluma whispers from inside Nightingale, it\u2019s dark voice tells her that Elias is too weak to be the one to kill her. Nightingale can\u2019t believe it, but she agrees with the Maluma. Elias is shaky, and as he pulls a dagger from his side, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019ll emotionally suffer doing the deed. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale is urged by the Maluma to suggest that Damocles be the one to do the dirty work.

She decides to try and find another way to get her daughter to Middara.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Teegan departs, letting them know she\u2019s thankful and hopes to meet again one day. </span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defeated, and under the impression they mean to kill him, the man angrily tells the group to finish what they came here to do.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nightingale quickly explains who she is. She points out that they entered via a hidden tunnel that was dug outside of the estate. Nightingale tries to explain that they aren\u2019t here to harm anyone. Instead, they are here to gather information.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just then, a man bursts through the cellar door nearby. Flanked by a set of guards, he calls for his ally by the name of Damocles, worried that he has been hurt by the intruders. The guards surge forward to seize the Nightingale and the others.</span></li>", "<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Damocles calls to his father, urging him to refrain from arresting anyone. Nightingale helps Damocles stand.

He introduces himself as Elias Hyde and explains that he is personal friends with Balthazar.
